# A-Real-time-Simulation-and-Visualization-of-the-Microburst
The microburst is a special meteorological condition that affects the flight heavily. It threats to the aircraft seriously during takeoff and landing. A real-time visually simulation method of the microburst was presented to generate vivid 3D wind field for the flight simulation software or game. It may be used to improve pilots' ability to deal with unexpected microburst situation. The presented method used a circleâ€™s tangent model as a simplified mathematical approximation of the microburst. The simulated wind field was visualized by the common particle system overlapped a polygon trailing component. Experimental simulation scenes on the Unity engine show that the proposed method is easy to program and achieves real-time frame rate on a common PC.
